Why are my API URLs here?    
Why did I not put them in separate files? I understand perfectly well that API keys and API URLs should be put in separate env files But the reason I didn't do that for this project is that it's a demo project and due to ease of use. It will be a lot easier for you to run this project on your device without having to do extra work with putting your API keys and URLs in env files.
