 Why are my api urls here ?   
 Why did I not put them in seperate files ? 
I understand perfectly well that API keys and API urls should be put in a seperate env files 
 But the reason I didn't do that for this project is because it's a demo project
 and due to ease of use. It will be a lot easier for you to run this projectonyour devices 
without having to do extra work with puting your own API keys and urls in env files.
